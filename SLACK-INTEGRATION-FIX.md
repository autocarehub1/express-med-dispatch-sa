# Slack Integration Fix Documentation

## Issue
No Slack messages were being triggered after request submission on the website.

## Root Causes & Fixes
We identified and fixed several issues with the Slack integration:

1. **Incorrect URL Path** - The application was using hardcoded relative paths ('/api/slack/send') instead of getting the full URL from the current window location. This fails in some environments.

2. **Inadequate Error Handling** - The code didn't properly handle or log errors from Slack API calls, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues.

3. **No Fallback Mechanisms** - The application lacked proper fallback mechanisms when the primary Slack notification method failed.

## Implemented Fixes

1. **Dynamic Base URL** - Modified all API endpoint calls to use `window.location.origin` to construct the full URL:
   ```js
   const baseUrl = window.location.origin;
   const apiUrl = `${baseUrl}/api/slack/send`;
   ```

2. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Added comprehensive error handling and logging throughout all Slack-related code.

3. **Multi-Channel Notification Strategy** - Implemented a robust multi-channel approach:
   - Primary: Unified Slack integration
   - Backup 1: Direct API call to the Slack endpoint
   - Backup 2: Events service notification

4. **API Route Improvements** - Enhanced the Slack API endpoint with better error handling and dual methods (axios + fetch) for greater reliability.

5. **Response Logging** - Added detailed response logging to better diagnose issues.

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   ./test-slack-integration.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Start the development server if not already running
   - Test the direct Slack webhook
   - Test the API route

2. **Test via the UI**:
   - Open the application in your browser (http://localhost:5050)
   - Submit a new delivery request
   - Check your Slack channel for notifications
   - Check browser console logs for any errors

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check your Slack webhook URL** - Verify the webhook URL is valid and hasn't been revoked:
   ```
   https://hooks.slack.com/services/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
   ```

2. **Check the Slack channel ID** - Ensure the channel ID is correct:
   ```
   C08S18NP5JA
   ```

3. **Verify API Routes** - Make sure the `/api/slack/send` endpoint is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/api/slack/send \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text":"API Test"}'
   ```

4. **Browser Console Logs** - Check for any errors in the browser console when submitting a request.

5. **Server Logs** - Check the terminal running your development server for error messages.

## Configuration

To update your Slack webhook or channel, modify these files:
- `src/services/EventsService.ts`
- `src/pages/api/slack/send.ts`
- `src/integrations/slack/slackClient.ts`
